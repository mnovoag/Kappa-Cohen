# My contribution
As a graduate student in Economics I contributed by calculating the Kappa-Cohen Index for two raters and observations for 10 clinical cases, as part of the above mentioned thesis in AI in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery for a Doctor in Medicine.

# What is the Kappa-Cohen Index?
It is a statistic that is used to measure inter-rater reliability (and also Intra-rater reliability) for qualitative (categorical) items.

# What does the code "kappa2" do in R?
Calculates Cohen's Kappa and weighted Kappa as an index of interrater agreement between 2 raters on categorical (or ordinal) data. Own weights for the various degrees of disagreement could be specified. Source (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/irr/versions/0.84.1/topics/kappa2)
